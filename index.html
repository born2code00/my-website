This Privacy Policy explains how Heaven and Hell (“the game”, “we”, “our”) handles user information.
<br>
No Account Creation
<br>
The game does not require users to create an account. No registration, login, or personal profile is needed to play.
<br>
No Personal Data Collection
<br>
We do not directly collect, store, or share any personal data such as:
<br>
- name
- email address
- phone number
- location
- contacts

<br>
Internet Usage
<br>
The game may use an internet connection for basic functionality. However, this connection is not used to collect personal information from users.
<br>
No Advertisements
<br>
The game does not display ads and does not use advertising SDKs.
<br>

<br>
The game does not integrate third-party services that collect personal data (such as analytics, ads, or tracking tools).
<br>
Children’s Privacy
